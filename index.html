        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Jason, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. 
          I enjoy learning how computers work as a whole, from low-level hardware and systems all the way up to high-level software and applications.
          I have taken a keen interest in the C-Programming language and am currently writing a replica of portions of the C++ stl library in C.
          <br>
          A few of my favourite courses so far have been Algorithm Design and Analysis (CPSC 320), Probability (MATH 302), and Relational Databases (CPSC 304).
          <br>
          Some future courses I am looking forward to take are Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, and Machine Learning.
          <br>
          I hope to get a job in software engineering, building upon the topics I have learned in school.
        </p>
